# Bus Panel

This is one of the two projects I made to learn rust. It uses Warsaw's public transport API to generate a panel of upcoming bus arrivals. The front-end is highly customizable, and you can use this to display the arrivals of any bus in Warsaw.

In the future, I plan on improving the performance of the back-end, as it is not very effective right now.
